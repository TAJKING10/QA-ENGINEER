## 🎯 Overview

This project implements a **production-grade test suite** for a cryptocurrency price fetching function that is **critical infrastructure** for Token Metrics' trading operations. The test suite covers:

✅ **Normal operations** (200 OK responses)
✅ **API failures** (500, 503 errors with retry logic)
✅ **Bad data cases** (negative prices, null values, missing fields)
✅ **Rate limiting** (429 responses with Retry-After handling)
✅ **Edge cases** (malformed JSON, concurrent requests, cache isolation)
✅ **Security scenarios** (API compromise, data corruption detection)

**Philosophy:** In financial systems, we must **fail safely**. Invalid price data should **block trading** rather than cause financial losses.

## 💼 What This Demonstrates

*The assignment states this mirrors real job responsibilities:*
> "You will be responsible for quality gates around functions that directly affect user funds and rebalances."

### How This Assignment Mirrors the Job

#### 1. **Edge Case Thinking Under High Volatility** ✅
**Job Requirement:** *"Edge case thinking under high volatility"*

**How I Demonstrated This:**
- **TC-501:** High volatility rapid calls - Multiple price requests during market crash
- **TC-503:** Prolonged outage with stale cache - Cache age during 50% price swings
- **TC-502:** Intermittent failures with recovery - API degrading then recovering
- **Cache strategy:** Different behavior for transient vs. data integrity errors

**Real-world scenarios tested:**
```python
# Flash crash: BTC drops 50% in 2 minutes
- System must fetch current prices, not rely on stale cache
- Rate limiting kicks in during high traffic
- Cache used only when safe (transient errors, not corruption)
```

---

#### 2. **Deciding Which Failures Must Block Trading or Deploys** ✅
**Job Requirement:** *"Deciding which failures must block trading or deploys"*

**How I Demonstrated This:**
- **CRITICAL severity (11 tests):** Block trading immediately
  - Negative prices → Financial catastrophe
  - Zero prices → Division errors
  - API failure without cache → Cannot trade
  - Cache pollution → Wrong prices returned

- **HIGH severity (15 tests):** Alert + fail-safe
  - Missing data with cache → Degrade gracefully
  - Rate limiting → Respect Retry-After
  - Network timeout → Use cache temporarily

- **LOW severity (8 tests):** Log only
  - Successful operations
  - Performance optimizations

**Decision framework:**
```
Data integrity violation → CRITICAL → HALT TRADING
Transient API error + cache → HIGH → ALERT + CONTINUE
Normal operations → LOW → LOG ONLY
```

---

#### 3. **Designing Tests that Fit into CI, Not Just Ad Hoc Scripts** ✅
**Job Requirement:** *"Designing tests that fit into CI, not just ad hoc scripts"*

**How I Demonstrated This:**

**Pytest markers for selective execution:**
```bash
pytest -m critical  # Only merge-blocking tests
pytest -m high      # Alert-worthy tests
pytest -m low       # Logging tests
```

**GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline:**
- ✅ **Critical test job** - Blocks PR merge if fails
- ✅ **Multi-Python versions** - Tests on 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11
- ✅ **Coverage enforcement** - Requires ≥95%
- ✅ **Linting and type checking** - Code quality gates

**Quality gates:**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/test.yml
critical-tests:  # MERGE BLOCKER
  - pytest -m critical
  - If fails → BLOCK MERGE

security-scan:
  - pip-audit
  - Advisory only
```

**NOT ad hoc scripts:**
- ❌ Manual test runs
- ❌ One-off validation scripts
- ❌ Tests that only work locally

**Production-ready CI:**
- ✅ Automated on every PR
- ✅ Reproducible across environments
- ✅ Clear pass/fail criteria
- ✅ Blocks bad code from merging

## 🚦 Severity Classifications

### Why Severity Matters

In production systems handling **user funds**, not all test failures are equal. Our severity framework ensures the right failures block deployment:

### CRITICAL Severity (Block Trading Immediately)

| Scenario | Why Critical | Example Test |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| **Negative price** | Would cause financial catastrophe | `TC-201` |
| **Zero price** | Division errors, invalid trades | `TC-202` |
| **API failure without cache** | Cannot trade without prices | `TC-104` |
| **Symbol mismatch** | Returning ETH price when BTC requested | `TC-206` |
| **Cache pollution** | Different symbols sharing cached prices | `TC-404` |

**Decision:** These failures **must halt all trading**. Better to stop than lose user funds.

---

### HIGH Severity (Alert + Fail-Safe)

| Scenario | Why High | Mitigation |
|----------|----------|------------|
| **Missing price with cache** | Temporary API issue | Use cache briefly |
| **Rate limiting (429)** | Resource constraint, not data issue | Respect Retry-After |
| **Network timeout with cache** | Transient network problem | Degrade gracefully |

**Decision:** System can continue with **degraded mode** (using cache), but operators are alerted.

---

### LOW Severity (Log Only)

| Scenario | Why Low | Impact |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **Successful operations** | Expected behavior | None |
| **High precision prices** | Edge case, works correctly | None |
| **Cache hit performance** | Optimization, not correctness | None |

**Decision:** Log for monitoring but don't block deployment.

## 🧠 Key Design Decisions

### 1. Why Mock Implementation?

The assignment stated "You do not implement this function." However, I included a **mock implementation** (`src/price_client.py`) to:

✅ **Demonstrate integration** - Shows how tests plug into real code
✅ **Prove test quality** - Tests actually work against running code
✅ **Show error handling design** - Custom exception hierarchy
✅ **Enable future extension** - Can swap mock with real Hyperliquid API

**This was an optional stretch goal** - the tests are designed to work with **any implementation** of `get_hyperliquid_price()`.

---

### 2. Why These Exact Severity Levels?

**CRITICAL** = Could cause **direct financial loss** or **system-wide halt**

Examples:
- Negative price: Trading with negative values = infinite losses
- No cache on total failure: Cannot trade without data

**HIGH** = Serious but **fail-safes exist**

Examples:
- Missing data with cache: Cache provides continuity
- Rate limiting: Not a data issue, just resource constraint

**LOW** = Edge cases with **minimal impact**

Examples:
- Successful operations (validation tests)
- Performance characteristics

This framework ensures:
- Merge-blocking failures are truly critical
- Teams aren't desensitized by false alarms
- Safe degradation is preferred over total failure

---

### 3. Why Cache Fallback for Some Errors But Not Others?

**Use cache for TRANSIENT errors:**
- Network timeouts
- 500 server errors
- Missing price field
- Rate limiting

*Rationale:* These indicate temporary API unavailability, not data corruption.

**Do NOT use cache for DATA INTEGRITY errors:**
- Negative prices
- Zero prices
- Non-numeric values

*Rationale:* These indicate API compromise or corruption. Using "good" cached data **masks a critical problem**.

**Philosophy:** Distinguish between "API is temporarily down" vs. "API is returning bad data."

---

### 4. Why Fail-Fast Option for Rate Limiting?

Two modes:

**Normal mode (`fail_fast_on_rate_limit=False`):**
- Wait for Retry-After duration
- Retry request
- Good for: Background jobs, scheduled rebalances

**Fail-fast mode (`fail_fast_on_rate_limit=True`):**
- Immediately raise RateLimitError
- Let caller decide strategy
- Good for: High-frequency trading, time-sensitive operations

*Rationale:* During a market flash crash, waiting 60 seconds for a price is worse than failing fast and using cached data or skipping the operation.

## 🤝 What I Did vs. AI Assistance

*As requested in the assignment README requirement: "What I did myself vs what AI helped with"*

### What I Did Myself (My Contributions)

#### 1. **Test Strategy and Architecture**
- Designed the severity classification framework (CRITICAL/HIGH/LOW)
- Decided which failures should block trading vs. allow cache fallback
- Structured the decision matrix for "block vs. continue"
- Prioritized test cases based on financial risk

#### 2. **Test Plan Reasoning**
- Wrote the justifications for each severity level
- Explained why negative prices are CRITICAL but rate limiting is HIGH
- Designed the fail-safe philosophy (fail loudly on data integrity violations)
- Created the risk analysis matrix

#### 3. **Real-World Scenario Thinking**
- Identified edge cases from crypto domain knowledge:
  - Flash crashes (high volatility rapid calls)
  - API compromise scenarios (negative prices as attack vector)
  - Symbol mismatch risks (returning wrong asset's price)
  - Stale cache during volatility (price changes 50% while cached)

#### 4. **Quality Gates Design**
- Defined the CI/CD pipeline stages
- Specified which tests block PR merge vs. deployment vs. are advisory
- Set coverage thresholds (95%) based on financial system standards

#### 5. **Review and Refinement**
- Reviewed all AI-generated code for correctness
- Ensured test cases actually test what they claim to test
- Verified mock responses match real Hyperliquid API patterns
- Validated test plan aligns with Token Metrics' needs (TM100 rebalancing, user funds protection)

---

### What AI Helped With (Claude Code Assistant)

#### 1. **Boilerplate Code Generation**
- pytest test structure and fixtures
- Mock objects setup (requests.Session, response objects)
- Python project scaffolding (requirements.txt, pytest.ini, .gitignore)

#### 2. **Code Volume**
- Writing 34 test cases with similar structure (arrange-act-assert pattern)
- Creating comprehensive docstrings for each test
- Generating GitHub Actions workflow YAML

#### 3. **Documentation Formatting**
- Markdown table generation
- Test matrix visualizations
- ASCII diagrams (decision trees, architecture flows)

#### 4. **Python Best Practices**
- Proper use of pytest fixtures and markers
- Exception handling patterns
- Type hints and docstring conventions

#### 5. **Implementation Details**
- Mock implementation of `get_hyperliquid_price()` (stretch goal)
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Cache implementation using Python dict

---

### Collaboration Model

**I provided:**
- Strategic thinking (what to test, why it matters)
- Domain expertise (crypto market behavior, financial system requirements)
- Risk assessment (severity classifications, fail-safe decisions)
- Quality standards (coverage thresholds, merge blocking criteria)

**AI provided:**
- Rapid code generation (tests, mocks, configs)
- Consistent formatting (docstrings, markdown)
- Boilerplate reduction (pytest fixtures, GitHub Actions)
- Syntax correctness (Python idioms, proper mocking)

**Result:** I focused on the **"what" and "why"** (test strategy, severity reasoning), while AI accelerated the **"how"** (implementing 34 tests quickly with consistent quality).

## 🔍 High Signal Checkpoints (Assignment Requirements)

### ✅ "How you distinguish between 'log and continue' vs 'block trading immediately'"

**Answer:** See [Severity Classifications](#severity-classifications) and `docs/TEST_PLAN.md` Section 2.

**TL;DR:**
- **Block trading:** Data integrity violations (negative price, zero, corruption)
- **Log and continue:** Transient errors with valid cache (network timeout, rate limit)

**Key insight:** Distinguish between "API is temporarily down" (use cache) vs. "API is returning bad data" (halt trading).

---

### ✅ "How you think about realistic API failure patterns, not just one-off cases"

**Answer:** See test scenarios in `tests/test_price.py`:

**Realistic patterns implemented:**
- **Intermittent failures:** API works, fails, works again (TC-502)
- **Gradual degradation:** 10% of requests fail, 90% succeed (TC-103)
- **Flash crash scenario:** 10,000 users hit API simultaneously (Test Matrix)
- **Prolonged outage:** API down for 30+ minutes, cache goes stale (TC-503)
- **Rate limit cascade:** Hit rate limit, retry storm from multiple services

**Not just:**
- Single isolated 500 error
- One-off network timeout

---

### ✅ "Quality and clarity of the Test Plan document"

**Test Plan Highlights:**
- Executive summary with fail-safe philosophy
- Severity framework with decision matrix
- 30+ test cases with expected behavior and severity
- Risk analysis table (probability × impact)
- Real-world scenarios (flash crash, API compromise)
- Pass/fail criteria for CI/CD gates

**See:** [`docs/TEST_PLAN.md`](docs/TEST_PLAN.md)

## 🚀 Next Steps for Production

If this were a real production system, I would recommend:

### 1. **Cache TTL Implementation**
Currently, cache never expires. Add:
```python
class PriceCache:
    def set(self, symbol, price, ttl=300):  # 5 min default
        self._cache[symbol] = {
            'price': price,
            'timestamp': time.time()
        }

    def get(self, symbol, max_age=300):
        if symbol in self._cache:
            if time.time() - self._cache[symbol]['timestamp'] < max_age:
                return self._cache[symbol]['price']
        return None
```

### 2. **Monitoring and Alerting**
- Prometheus metrics: `price_fetch_errors_total`, `cache_hit_rate`
- PagerDuty alerts on:
  - Negative price detected (critical, immediate)
  - Cache hit rate drops below 50% (investigate)
  - >5% error rate over 5 minutes (alert on-call)

### 3. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**
Stop hitting API after N consecutive failures:
```python
class CircuitBreaker:
    # Open circuit after 5 failures, close after 60s
    # Prevents retry storm during total outage
```

### 4. **Price Bounds Validation**
Add sanity checks:
```python
PRICE_BOUNDS = {
    'BTC': (10000, 500000),  # Min/max reasonable prices
    'ETH': (500, 50000),
}
# Reject prices outside bounds (likely data error)
```

### 5. **Load Testing**
Run load tests:
- 1000 requests/sec sustained
- 10,000 concurrent users during flash crash
- Validate cache hit rate >80% under load
